Use

+ when it starts, server loads data from MySQL to the model in main memory
+ when the model in main memory changes, the database is updated
+ server programming uses the model in main memory and not the database
+ todo_server_dartling_mysql reacts to changes in the model by updating mysql

1. in MySQL Workbench create a new schema (database) with the todo name
2. run tests in test/mysql_test.dart to create tables
3. put a path to the project folder in the working directory field in
   Run/Manage Launches (in order to have access to the connection.options file).
4. run server (bin/server.dart) in Dart Editor;
   it runs when you see in the server.dart tab in Dart Editor:
   Server at http://127.0.0.1:8080;
   if it does not run, use Run/Manage Launches
5. run client (todo_client_idb/web/app.html) in Dartium
6. run client as JavaScript (todo_client_idb/web/app.html) in Chrome
7. use the client app in Dartium:
   4.1 From server to integrate server data locally
   4.2 add, remove and update tasks (saved locally in IndexedDB by default)
   4.3 To server to integrate local data to server
8. use the client app in Chrome:
   5.1 From server to integrate server data locally
   5.2 add, remove and update tasks (saved locally in IndexedDB by default)
   5.3 To server to integrate local data to server
